# Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations. This project leverages machine learning to predict whether an employee is likely to leave based on key factors such as salary, work-life balance, and job satisfaction. The system includes an interactive web-based UI built using **Streamlit**.

## 🛠️ Features
- Predicts employee attrition using **Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting**.
- Allows users to input employee details via a **Streamlit UI** and get a prediction result.
- Displays feature importance and visual insights for HR decision-making.
- Simple and interactive UI without requiring complex frontend development.

## 📂 Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web App:** **Streamlit** for UI
- **Backend:** Handled within Streamlit (No separate backend required)

## 📊 Dataset
- IBM HR Analytics Dataset from Kaggle.
- Contains employee details such as **Job Role, Monthly Income, Overtime, Work-Life Balance**, etc.
